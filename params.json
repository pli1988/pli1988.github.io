In these ”shallow” architectures, feature engineering and learn-\r\ning are typically disjoint and unrelated. Additionally, feature engineering is difficult, and typically depends on extensive\r\ndomain expertise.In this report, we present an application of convolutional neural networks for the task of automatic musical instrument identification. In this model, feature extraction and learning algorithms are trained together in an end-to-end fashion. We show that a convolutional neural network trained on raw audio can achieve performance surpassing traditional methods that rely on hand-crafted features.

In this report, we investigate the efficacy of Encoder-decoder systems for the task of phoneme recognition. [pdf](./papers/ASR.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Speech Enhancement with Matrix Factorization\r\nIn this report, we explore techniques for speech enhancement using matrix factorization. We focus on enhancing speech signals corrupted with environmental noise. We implement unsupervised and \"semi-supervised\" methods that do not rely on access to uncorrupted speech for model training. [pdf](./papers/speechEnhancement.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Social Networks\r\n\r\n### Inferring Demographic Attributes of Social Media Users Using Label Propagation\r\nIn this paper, we propose a method to infer demographic attributes of social media users. We present a model that uses\r\nsocial ties between users to infer demographic attributes. This is a graph-based algorithm that leverages homophily by spreading age labels on the the @mention network.\r\n\r\nThis is  a project that I worked on during a summer internship at HRL Laboratories. It was presented at WIN 2015. [pdf](./papers/WIN.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
