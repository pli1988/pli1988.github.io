<p>Here's a collection of projects that I've worked on in the past couple of years:</p>

<p>Traditional methods to tackle many music information retrieval tasks typically follow a two-step architecture: feature
engineering followed by a simple learning algorithm. In these ”shallow” architectures, feature engineering and learn-
ing are typically disjoint and unrelated. Additionally, feature engineering is difficult, and typically depends on extensive
domain expertise.In this report, we present an application of convolutional neural networks for the task of automatic musical instrument identification. In this model, feature extraction and learning algorithms are trained together in an end-to-end fashion. We show that a convolutional neural network trained on raw audio can achieve performance surpassing traditional methods that rely on hand-crafted features. <a href="./papers/sourceID.pdf">pdf</a></p>

<p>Encoder-decoder models are a powerful class of models that let us learn mappings from variable length input sequences to variable length output sequences. In this report, we investigate the efficacy of Encoder-decoder systems for the task of phoneme recognition. <a href="./papers/ASR.pdf">pdf</a></p>

<p>In this report, we explore techniques for speech enhancement using matrix factorization. We focus on enhancing speech signals corrupted with environmental noise. We implement unsupervised and "semi-supervised" methods that do not rely on access to uncorrupted speech for model training. <a href="./papers/speechEnhancement.pdf">pdf</a></p>

<p>In this paper, we propose a method to infer demographic attributes of social media users. We present a model that uses
social ties between users to infer demographic attributes. This is a graph-based algorithm that leverages homophily by spreading age labels on the the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> network.</p>

<p>This is  a project that I worked on during a summer internship at HRL Laboratories. It was presented at WIN 2015. <a href="./papers/WIN.pdf">pdf</a></p>
